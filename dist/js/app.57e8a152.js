Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your left (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously lean forward slightly at your hips while maintaining the adominal bracing to keep the spine extended and rotate to your right while continuing to hold the medicine ball in front of your mid-section.","From the lowered position, rotate back to the left so that you are facing straight ahead, firmly push the left foot in to the ground and pull yourself back to a standing position by drving the left knee straight back to create knee and hip extension simultaneously. As you are pulling yourself foward with the left leg, pick the right foot off of the ground and slowly swing it forward to initiate the next lunge.","Continue the walking lunge with rotation for a specific number of repetitions or a certain distance.","One variation is to contract the abdominals and glutes at the top of the stance phase (for example while balanced on the right leg with the left leg off of the ground) for 2-3 seconds to create a balance challenge. Another variation is to add more resistance by holding one dumbbell in each hand with the elbows bent at 90 degrees and pressed into the sides of the abdominals."],"id":139,"url_title":"walking-lunges-with-twists","images_no":7},{"category":"Butt & Hip Exercises","title":"Warrior I","bodyPart":["Butt/Hips","Full Body/Integrated","Legs - Thighs"],"equipment":"No Equipment","difficulty":"Beginner","steps":["Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward and arms by your sides.
